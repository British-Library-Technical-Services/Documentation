The first Prism Sound Titan in the stack is set to capture audio inputs 1-8 and is the source Master clock. The second Titan is set to capture audio inputs 9-16 and is sync’d to the first Titan. Both Titans are installed with MDIO-Dante modules connected via an RJ45 connection. All 16 inputs are passed through the first Titan and output over RJ45 to the Dante Virtual Soundcard (DVS). The front panel of the Titan should display a green light on the following indicators: . | IP | Line | Master* | . *Titan 1 only . 1.1.1 Prism Sound Audio Control app . The Titan’s software control panel is the central tool to assign settings. Two instances of the application will open for the two connected Titans in the stack. The Titans can be identifed by their assigned name on the top bar (e.g. Dante-PS-Dante-01xxxd), to confirm their identity click Identify on the main control panel and the lights on the front panel of the selected Titan will flash.

Filenames for sound files must be comprised of five fields (with an optional sixth of ‘item number’): . | 1 |   | 2 |   | OPTION |   | 3 |   | 4 |   | 5 | . | Originator | _ | Shelf Mark | _ | Item Number | _ | Side Number | _ | File Number | _ | Version Number | . Rules . | Fields may not be omitted with exception of ‘item numbers’ | Fields are separated by an underscore (‘_’) | No whitespace allowed (‘ ‘) | Do not pad with zeros | . 1. Originator . A record of where the digital file was digitised, typically the institution. | Description | Example | . | British Library, London | BL_ | . 2. Shelf Mark . The Shelf Mark of the physical item from which the digital file was created. Replace any existing separators in your Shelf Mark (e.g. ‘/’, ‘.’, ‘ ‘, &amp;c.) with a hyphen (‘-‘) as necessary . | Description | Example | . | C182/4 | BL_C182-4_ | . OPTION. Item Number . Where multiple physical items have been accessioned under a single Shelf Mark, e.g. published box sets, double cd releases. Add an ‘item number’ to ensure filenames remain unique. This is the only optional element in the schema and should be omitted where unique Shelf Marks exist for individual items. | Description | Example | . | First item from a box set of eight CDs | BL_1SS0005728i1 | . 3. Side Number . Record the Side of the physical item from which the file was made. A Side is defined as a change in a recorded sequence’s direction, relative to the other recorded sequences or the physical action needed to play the other sequences on the tape (i.e. turning a tape over). For born-digital files use ‘s0’. | Description | Example | . | First side of a cassette | BL_C182-4_s1 | . | Second side of a cassette | BL_C182-4_s2 | . 4. File Number . Record the order of each file in relation to its side. All files should start at ‘1’. Files numbered 1-9 should be should preceded with a zero (e.g. ‘f01’). | Description | Example | . | Fourth track from a CD-R | BL_C1298-110_s1_f04 | . 5. Version Number . Record the version number of the file. In the vast majority of cases, only one version of a file will be created. In cases where subjective choices have been made (alternate stylus choice, playback speed &amp;c.) requiring multiple files, identify the files using incrementing version numbers, preceded by a ‘v’ character (v2, v3, etc.). | Description | Example | . | Second version of the fourth file from the second side of BL item C182/4 | BL_C182-4_s2_f04_v2 | .

Signal recorded on one channel of a multichannel (half-track, quarter-track) tape is audible in the adjacent channel(s) during playback. For example a half-track tape, with two seperate recordings running in opposite directions, the audio in the Right channel is audible (in reverse) in the Left channel during replay. This is typically a result of the guard-band (the channel seperator) of the tape recording machine’s record head being a narrower width than the replay machine’s, causing the audio to ‘leak’ between channels | . | Drop out | Audio signal disappears for a period of time | . | Hiss | High pitched noise. Can be inherent surface noise of the carrier, a result of physical damage or a defect with the orignal recorder | . | Locked groove | Disc transfer. Stylus is stuck in a groove and traces the same section of audio over an over again. Typically caused by surface damage that ‘locks’ the stylus in the same groove revolution.

Recordings typically exhibit broadcast inteference in the form of noise and distortion | . | Print-through | Tape / cassette transfer. An audible ‘echo’ caused by the transfer of magnetic energy between layers of wound tape. Depending on how the tape is stored the echo can be heard before the prominent signal (pre-echo) or after (post-echo) | . | Pops / clicks | Disc transfer. Sharp transient sounds caused by surface damage to the disc | . | Poor tracking | Disc transfer.
