# British Library Technical Services Documentation
The Technical Services team in Sound & Vision is responsible for the preservation of the Libraryâ€™s physical sound collection, the development of technologies to preserve future digital acquisitions, and for making our collections accessible to those who wish to hear them.

This is the central documentation repository for audio preservation undertaken at the British Library.
