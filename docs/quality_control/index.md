# Quality Control

Quality Control (QC) is the final stage of the digitisation workflow.

An engineer will assess a percentage of their colleagues transfer work to ensure the necessary best practice and standards are met.  The work is completed by assessing the quality of the technical transfer and its accompanying metadata.

QC is necessary for collections consisting of five or more items.  Collections with less than five items should have their status set to _Not Required_ in the Tracking Database.

Full QC guidelines for audio preservation can be found in the Table of Contents below.
