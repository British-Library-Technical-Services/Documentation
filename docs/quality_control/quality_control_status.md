# Quality Control Status
Once the Quality Control (QC) checks are complete, the QC Engineer  should update the Tracking Database to reflect the QC status with the following fields:

| Field | Value |
|:---|:---|
| QC Date | DD/MM/YY |
| QC Status | Pass, Fail, Not Required |
| QC Engineer | Name |
| QC Notes | Any relevant notes |

## Recording the Status

### Pass
All QC checks pass and the no further action is required

### Fail
If one or more checks has not been met, the item should be marked as _Fail_ and the relevant details added to the QC Notes field for the Transfer Engineer.  The Transfer Engineer should be notified and the original item returned to them for remedial action.

### Resolved
When the QC _Fail_ is subsequently fixed the Transfer Engineer should update the status to _Resolved_ and add any relevant details to QC Notes field.  

### Not Required
Items in the collection that are not subject to QC checks should have their status set to _Not Required_.
