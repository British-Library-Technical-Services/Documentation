# Spectrum Analysis

Analysis of the audio signal via its frequency spectrum can highlight issues that are not easily identifiable through the waveform view alone, such as sample-clock errors.

The Spectrogram view in Wavelab 10.x is accessible from the main Editor Window.

Many sample-clock errors are not visible from the default settings so it is advisable to adjust the amplitude range to see more of the frequency spectrum.
