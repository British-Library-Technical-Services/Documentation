# Downloading Files

Copies of files attached to a SIP can be downloaded for access purposes.  For SIPs that have not yet been submitted for ingest, files are downloaded directly within the AV SIP Generator.  For Information Packages that have been submitted and ingested into the Library's digital repository, files are downloaded via the DLS Downloader.

_Note: both methods will download **copies** of the files so any changes made will not affect the files attached to the Information Package_

## 1. Pre-Ingest File Download

1. Search the item Shelfmark in the **Pickup SIP** search box
